# Introduction to the application and RADON

This is a lab which provides an introduction to
the RADON framework, and the example application
we are working with. By completing all the labs in
this repository, you will be able to understand
and use parts of the RADON framework to deploy any
serverless application to the cloud.

## Application introduction

The application which we will deploy is taken from
[Kraig Hufstedler's todo-list application](https://github.com/kraigh/serverless-todo-api).

The application aids in showcasing the creation
and deployment of a serverless application. From a
functionality point of view, it realizes a
serverless API application, exposing several
functions through an API Gateway that modify a
database on the cloud.
